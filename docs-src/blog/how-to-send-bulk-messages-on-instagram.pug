    # How To Send Bulk Messages On Instagram

    Social Media Apps like Instagram and TikTok are quickly evolving beyond the umbrella term "Social Media Apps".
    For many people, these apps have become work places. They are used to run primary businesses that
    serve as means of livelihood.

    The popular use case of running businesses on Instagram has introduced an increasing demand for ways to do things more efficiently while on the App.

    In this guide, we will be showing you how you can send bulk Instagram messages (to multiple recipients at once) using the [IGdm Pro](https://pro.igdm.me) app.
    Say goodbye to manual, time-consuming messaging and hello to efficiency and convenience.

    &nbsp;&nbsp;
    #### The Instagram Dilemma

    Instagram's user-friendly interface shines when it comes to visual content sharing. However,
    If you've ever tried to announce an event, launch, or simply send a personalized greeting to
    your followers, you're probably all too familiar with the manual process of sending messages
    one by one. It's not only time-consuming but can be mind-numbing when you have a lengthy list
    of recipients.

    &nbsp;&nbsp;
    #### Using the IGdm Pro App

    [IGdm Pro](https://pro.igdm.me) is a handy application that has been designed to improve the effeciency of users who run businesses
    with their Instagram accounts. Asides from the bulk messaging functionality, IGdm Pro also
    offers **[message scheduling](https://igdm.me/blog/how-to-schedule-instagram-messages)**, **quick replies**, **message reminders**, **conversation labelling**

    - In the usernames field, paste the usernames of the recipients who you're sending the message to. You can either paste a comma separated list like this "elonmusk, jeffbezos, zuck", or you can separate them with white space like this "elonmusk jeffbezos zuck".
    - In the message field, type in the message you would like to send to all these users.
    - To include personalised content (such as each user's display name or username) into your message, hover on the "Insert Variables" button, and click the desired variable you want to include. When the messages are being sent to each user, IGdm Pro will replace the variables with the user's actual username or display name.
    - Once you are done composing your message, simply click the "Send Bulk Message" to get it sent. The messages will begin sending the in background. You can close the pop-up and check back to see the progress of the messages being sent.

    **NOTE:** In order for all the messages to be sent, you are required to keep the IGdm Pro app running while the messages are being sent.

    #### IGdm Pro's Smart Approach To Instargam Bulk Messages

    [IGdm Pro](https://pro.igdm.me) avoids over-flooding Instagram's servers when sending Bulk Messages to various users at once. It achieves this by sending the message to each user at different intervals.
    What this means is that, the bulk messages do not get sent at the same time. Instead, IGdm Pro picks the first user, sends the message to them, and waits for some minutes
    before proceeding to pick the second user, and so forth.

    &nbsp;&nbsp;

    In a world where time is precious and efficiency is key, [IGdm Pro](https://pro.igdm.me) is a game-changer for Instagram users looking to streamline their business efforts on the App.
